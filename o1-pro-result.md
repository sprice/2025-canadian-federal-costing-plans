## A. Executive Summary 
Both the Conservative Party’s “2025 Platform for Change – Fiscal Costing” (CPC JPEG) and the Liberal Party’s “Canada Strong – Fiscal and Costing Plan” (LPC JPEG) present multi-year projections for revenues, program expenditures, and resulting deficits through 2028–29. Each platform uses the Parliamentary Budget Office’s (PBO) baseline deficit as a starting point but diverges based on proposed tax measures, program expansions or cuts, and anticipated macroeconomic responses (e.g., revenue from higher housing construction or repealed regulations).

From the CPC tables (pp. 1–2, CPC JPEG), new revenue measures are expected to add CAD 12.4 billion in 2025–26, though that figure becomes negative the following year before turning positive again. The CPC plan also details a “net reduction in program spending” of CAD 3.0 billion in 2025–26, rising to nearly CAD 9.8 billion by 2028–29. Deficits under this plan are projected to decrease from CAD 31.4 billion in 2025–26 to CAD 14.2 billion in 2028–29.

By contrast, the LPC JPEG includes tables of future revenues and expenditures but provides limited numerical clarity in the excerpt. While it references a declining deficit trajectory, specific revenue and spending line items are partially obscured, making exact side-by-side comparisons challenging. Both platforms assume enhanced economic growth from their respective tax and regulatory changes but differ on methods—particularly regarding housing, carbon pricing, and social programs.

Although neither document offers a fully transparent debt-to-GDP path, each suggests lower deficits by 2028–29 than in 2025–26. The extent to which these plans rely on optimistic growth, inflation, or behavioral assumptions is not fully spelled out. Voters and policymakers would benefit from additional details and sensitivity analyses before concluding that either platform’s targets are fully attainable.

## B. Side-by-Side Matrix (FY 2025–26 → 2028–29)

Below, “CPC” figures are from pp. 1–2 of the CPC JPEG. “LPC” figures are labeled “Data Not Fully Provided” where the second JPEG is incomplete.

**Notes:**
1. The LPC JPEG shows a declining deficit trajectory, but numeric details are partly unreadable.  
2. Neither JPEG provides explicit year-by-year federal debt totals or a clear debt-to-GDP ratio.

## C. Key Similarities & Differences by Policy Domain

### Taxation
- **Similarities**: Both platforms propose tax changes aimed at encouraging economic activity (e.g., CPC’s incentives for housing construction, LPC references to small business supports).  
- **Differences**: The CPC explicitly cuts the lowest personal income tax rate (p. 1, CPC JPEG) and repeals various carbon-related taxes; LPC references are less specific in the excerpt, though it implies continued environmental levies with possible relief for small businesses.

### Housing
- **Similarities**: Both highlight housing affordability. CPC projects revenue from “additional homes built” (p. 1, CPC JPEG). LPC’s text alludes to a “national housing plan,” though details are incomplete.  
- **Differences**: CPC would scrap the Underused Housing Tax and GST on new homes under CAD 1.3 million. LPC references are unclear but do not explicitly repeal the Underused Housing Tax.

### Climate & Environment
- **Similarities**: Both address environmental policy costs/benefits in their revenue/spending estimates.  
- **Differences**: CPC fully repeals the “Carbon Tax,” “Clean Fuel Regulations,” and “EV mandate” (pp. 1–2, CPC JPEG). LPC appears to maintain a carbon pricing framework, though specifics are not visible in the excerpt.

### Defence & Security
- **Similarities**: Limited direct comparison; both mention some increases for northern defence or border security.  
- **Differences**: CPC references “Ending the Housing Accelerator Fund” (p. 2, CPC JPEG) but no explicit large-scale defence expansion. LPC’s details on defence spending (e.g., Arctic sovereignty) appear incomplete.

### Social Programs
- **Similarities**: Both platforms include new spending on targeted social or regional programs.  
- **Differences**: CPC references partial expansions for small craft harbours, medical residency spots, and apprenticeship grants (p. 2, CPC JPEG). LPC data on social programs (e.g., health care transfers, childcare expansions) is not fully visible.

## D. Second-Order Effects (Projections, Not Certainties)

### CPC Platform
1. **Macroeconomy**: Cutting personal income taxes could stimulate short-term consumption. Large-scale regulatory repeals (e.g., EV mandate) might shift investment toward traditional sectors but risks underinvestment in green industries.  
2. **Social Equity & Wellbeing**: Removing GST on certain homes benefits middle-income buyers but reduces government revenues that might otherwise fund social services.  
3. **Environmental Sustainability**: Full carbon tax repeal and elimination of clean-fuel regulations could lower energy costs but may increase emissions and reduce compliance with climate targets.  
4. **International Competitiveness & Obligations**: Potentially boosts competitiveness in carbon-intensive sectors; however, Canada’s climate commitments may be harder to fulfill.

### LPC Platform
1. **Macroeconomy**: Retaining some environmental levies could encourage green-tech investment. Additional social spending might raise domestic demand but also require higher debt or taxes.  
2. **Social Equity & Wellbeing**: Proposed enhancements to housing and social services could mitigate inequality if well-targeted, though details on financing remain unclear.  
3. **Environmental Sustainability**: Sustaining carbon pricing likely reduces emissions but may raise near-term energy costs for households and businesses.  
4. **International Competitiveness & Obligations**: Maintaining carbon pricing aligns with commitments under international climate accords and could incentivize clean growth, though some sectors might face higher costs.

## E. Risk & Assumption Checklist
- **Economic Growth Rates**: Both sets of projections assume steady growth; a recession or slower GDP growth would reduce revenues.  
- **Behavioral Responses**: CPC reliance on new housing starts, plus changes to capital gains and carbon policy, assume private-sector responsiveness.  
- **Inflation & Interest Rates**: Higher interest rates increase public debt charges, altering deficit projections.  
- **Trade & Global Factors**: External demand for Canadian exports, resource prices, and geopolitical tensions can affect revenue from carbon-related measures and resource charges.  
- **Partial Data**: The LPC JPEG does not fully disclose itemized revenues and costs, making precise validation or comparison difficult.

## F. Questions for Voters & Policymakers
1. How do each platform’s growth assumptions compare with the PBO’s most recent economic outlook?  
2. Which specific social programs (if any) would see budget cuts under either plan if revenue shortfalls occur?  
3. How would each plan’s stance on carbon pricing align with Canada’s international climate commitments?  
4. What contingency measures exist if interest rates remain elevated beyond 2025–26?  
5. For housing measures, how have they accounted for supply chain constraints and skilled-labor shortages?
