# Comparative Analysis of CPC and LPC 2025 Fiscal Plans

## Executive Summary

The 2025 fiscal platforms of Canada's Conservative Party (CPC) and Liberal Party (LPC) present contrasting approaches to addressing the same baseline deficit projection of -$46.8 billion in 2025-26, gradually improving to -$29.1 billion by 2028-29. Both parties project deficit reduction over the four-year period, though through different strategies and with varying projected outcomes.

The CPC platform emphasizes revenue generation through regulatory repeals, tax reductions aimed at spurring economic activity, and program spending cuts. By 2028-29, they project a deficit of -$14.2 billion, representing a substantial reduction from baseline. Key measures include cutting the lowest personal income tax rate by 15%, repealing environmental regulations, and reducing public service through attrition.

The LPC platform focuses on targeted investments across four thematic areas: "Unite," "Secure," "Protect," and "Build." They project a similar deficit reduction trajectory, with a deficit-to-GDP ratio improving from -1.96% to -1.35% by 2028-29. Their plan includes significant infrastructure investment, expanded social programs, and revenue generation primarily through a tariff response and government efficiency improvements.

Both parties rely on one-time tariff response revenue of $20 billion in 2025-26. The CPC projects more aggressive deficit reduction by 2028-29, while the LPC forecasts higher capital spending with an operating surplus by the final year. The CPC emphasizes tax reductions and regulatory reforms, while the LPC focuses on targeted investments and maintaining social programs.

## Second-Order Effects

### Conservative Party Platform

**Macroeconomy**
- Tax cuts and regulatory repeals could stimulate economic growth through increased business investment and consumer spending, particularly the capital gains deferral holiday.
- Cutting red tape (25%) might reduce business compliance costs, potentially increasing productivity in affected sectors.
- Reduced public service employment through attrition could affect service delivery if not accompanied by process improvements.

**Social equity & wellbeing**
- Cutting the lowest personal income tax rate would provide proportional benefit to lower-income earners who pay this rate.
- Housing affordability measures may improve access for some buyers, but removing the Housing Accelerator Fund could affect overall housing supply.
- Protecting working seniors' income could improve financial security for this demographic group.

**Environmental sustainability**
- Repealing climate-related regulations would likely result in higher greenhouse gas emissions compared to baseline projections.
- Eliminating climate funds would reduce incentives for clean energy adoption at household and industrial levels.
- Environmental impacts may be offset somewhat by economic efficiency gains if regulatory streamlining reduces resource waste.

**International competitiveness & obligations**
- Reduced regulatory compliance costs could improve Canada's business competitiveness rankings.
- Repealing climate policies may create challenges for meeting international climate commitments.
- Military spending increases would move Canada closer to NATO spending targets.
- Cutting foreign aid could potentially reduce Canada's diplomatic influence in recipient countries.

### Liberal Party Platform

**Macroeconomy**
- Substantial infrastructure investments could stimulate short-term growth while potentially improving long-term productivity.
- Middle-class tax cuts may increase consumer spending power, stimulating demand-side growth.
- Skills training and education initiatives could improve workforce productivity over time.
- Significant government spending could contribute to inflationary pressures if not offset by productivity improvements.

**Social equity & wellbeing**
- Targeted measures for vulnerable groups could reduce inequalities in specific domains.
- Housing affordability measures focus on both supply expansion and demand support.
- Investments in healthcare infrastructure and programs could improve access in underserved areas.
- Support for post-secondary education and skills development may improve economic mobility.

**Environmental sustainability**
- Continued funding for environmental protection and climate initiatives would likely maintain Canada's trajectory on emissions reductions.

## Risk & Assumption Check-List

### Conservative Party Platform

- **Economic Growth Assumptions**:
  * Revenue projections from repealing environmental regulations (+$2,370M to +$11,664M over 4 years) assume significant economic growth will materialize from regulatory relief.
  * Tax cut stimulative effects assume the freed-up capital will be reinvested domestically rather than saved or invested abroad.

- **Implementation Feasibility**:
  * Cutting red tape by 25% (+$600M to +$3,300M) lacks specific implementation details.
  * Public service attrition savings assume predictable retirement rates and that 1/3 reduction won't impact service delivery.

- **Revenue Projections**:
  * Cracking down on tax evasion (+$1,500M to +$4,400M) historically proves difficult to achieve projected revenues.
  * One-time tariff response revenue (+$20,000M in 2025-26) has no details on implementation or international reaction.

- **Missing Data**:
  * No deficit-to-GDP ratio projections provided to contextualize deficit reduction relative to economic growth.
  * Limited details on implementation timelines for regulatory changes.

### Liberal Party Platform

- **Economic Growth Assumptions**:
  * Government productivity savings (+$6,000M to +$13,000M) lack specific implementation details.
  * Capital spending effects assume efficient project selection and implementation.

- **Implementation Feasibility**:
  * Building infrastructure with Indigenous communities (-$1,250M for two years) may face implementation challenges.
  * Multiple new programs require administrative capacity that may take time to establish.

- **Revenue Projections**:
  * One-time tariff response revenue (+$20,000M in 2025-26) is identical to CPC platform with limited details.
  * Increasing penalties and fines (+$750M to +$1,750M) may face enforcement challenges.

- **Missing Data**:
  * No direct statement of final deficit figures in dollars, only deficit-to-GDP ratios.
  * Limited details on specific measures comprising government productivity savings.

### Common Risks to Both Platforms

- **Global Economic Conditions**:
  * Both platforms face risks from potential global recession, trade disputes, or financial crises.
  * Energy price volatility could affect revenue projections.

- **Interest Rate Sensitivity**:
  * Rising interest rates could increase debt servicing costs beyond projections.

- **Geopolitical Instability**:
  * International trade tensions could affect the viability of the one-time tariff response revenue in both platforms.

## Questions for Voters & Policymakers

1. **Fiscal Sustainability**: Both platforms rely on one-time tariff response revenue of $20 billion in 2025-26. How sustainable are their deficit reduction paths if this revenue doesn't materialize or can't be repeated in future years?

2. **Environmental-Economic Trade-off**: The CPC projects substantial revenue gains from repealing environmental regulations, while the LPC maintains environmental programs at a cost. What are the long-term economic implications of these divergent approaches to climate policy, particularly regarding international trade relationships?

3. **Government Size and Efficiency**: The CPC proposes specific measures to reduce public service size and consultant spending, while the LPC projects larger but less-detailed productivity savings. Which approach offers more realistic prospects for improving government efficiency while maintaining service delivery?

4. **Housing Affordability**: Both platforms take different approaches to housing - the CPC focuses on reducing taxes and ending some existing programs, while the LPC emphasizes both supply and demand-side measures with higher spending. Which approach better addresses the root causes of Canada's housing challenges?

5. **Intergenerational Equity**: How do these fiscal plans allocate benefits and burdens across generations, considering deficit paths, environmental policies, housing affordability measures, and investments in future productivity?

This analysis presents fiscal data from both platforms without endorsing either approach. Readers should consider their own priorities and values when evaluating these policy alternatives.
