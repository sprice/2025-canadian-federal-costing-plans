## Executive Summary (≤ 300 words)

Both major parties propose significant fiscal departures from the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) baseline, but in opposite directions.  
*The Conservative Platform for Change* relies on **tax relief and regulatory roll-backs** to spur private-sector growth, pairing these with sizable program-spending **cuts** (e.g., consultant fees, CBC funding) to narrow the deficit from **-$46.8 bn to -$31.4 bn in FY 2025-26** and to **-$14.2 bn by FY 2028-29**.  
*The Liberal Canada Strong plan* layers **$35-33 bn per year in new investments**—in housing, health, defence and climate resilience—on top of the same PBO baseline.  These are only partly offset by new revenues (e.g., a one-off $20 bn tariff response) and assumed productivity savings, producing an **operating deficit of -$9.2 bn in FY 2025-26**; all-items deficit figures are not disclosed, though the plan targets a **deficit-to-GDP ratio of 1.96 % falling to 1.35 % by FY 2028-29**.

Both parties book a **$20 bn tariff retaliation windfall in 2025-26**, but diverge sharply thereafter:

* Conservatives prioritise broad tax cuts (15 % drop in the lowest PIT bracket) and full carbon-pricing repeal; Liberal tax relief is narrower (middle-class bracket, first-time buyers) and paired with *new* climate-adaptation outlays.
* Conservatives count on regulatory repeal (Clean Fuel Regs, EV mandate) to raise GDP and revenues; Liberals count on public-investment multipliers and “government productivity” savings.

Debt paths cannot be precisely compared because the Liberal plan withholds dollar-level debt projections.  Assuming the PBO’s GDP track, Conservative measures reduce cumulative deficits by **$40 bn over four years**; Liberal measures, on an all-items basis, appear to **raise cumulative deficits** unless capital investments are amortised outside the operating balance.

Overall, voters face a stark choice between a **smaller-government, lower-tax** trajectory and a **higher-spending, investment-led** trajectory, each with distinct economic, social and environmental implications. citeturn0file0turn0file1

## Key Similarities & Differences

### Taxation
* **Both** book the one-time $20 bn 2025-26 tariff response.  
* **CPC**: 15 % cut to lowest PIT bracket; repeal capital-gains hike; scrap GST on new homes < $1.3 m.  
* **LPC**: Middle-class rate cut (~$4.2 bn 25-26); targeted GST relief for first-time buyers; patent-box & R&D credits. citeturn0file0turn0file1

### Housing & Infrastructure
* **Both** incentivise housing supply, but CPC uses regulatory carrots plus HAF elimination; LPC funds *Build Canada Homes* ($2.8-3 bn/yr) and development-charge offsets.  
* Liberal platform adds major nation-building, grid and digital-infrastructure funds; CPC sells federal buildings and land to trim costs.

### Climate & Environment
* **CPC** repeals carbon tax, Clean Fuel Regs, EV mandate—reducing costs but raising emissions risk.  
* **LPC** invests in flood insurance, EV charging and Indigenous climate adaptation while introducing a Carbon Border Adjustment from 2027 (-$100 m rising to -$400 m revenue).

### Defence & Security
* **Both** ramp Northern/Arctic spending, but CPC allocates up to **-$6.5 bn** by 28-29; LPC phases in **$6.75 bn** operating plus capital by 28-29.  
* Gun policy diverges: CPC ends “Liberal gun grab”; LPC funds red/yellow-flag enforcement.

### Social Programs & Health
* **CPC** emphasises spending restraint, but funds medical residencies (+$70 m/yr) and caregiver credits.  
* **LPC** boosts health infrastructure, youth mental health, IVF, and maintains $10/day childcare top-ups.

## Second-Order Effects (Projections)

| Dimension | **Conservative Platform** | **Liberal Platform** |
|---|---|---|
| **Macroeconomy** | 1. Tax-cut-driven consumption bump could lift short-run GDP.<br>2. Regulatory repeal may spur fossil-energy investment, raising private capital formation.<br>3. Large tariff revenue is one-off; future growth assumptions hinge on sustained productivity gains. | 1. Public-investment surge likely raises aggregate demand and construction employment.<br>2. Middle-class tax cut partially offsets demand leakage from tariffs.<br>3. Higher deficits could crowd out private borrowing if rates rise. |
| **Social equity & wellbeing** | 1. PIT cut benefits all filers but skews to higher earners in dollar terms.<br>2. Savings from foreign-aid and CBC cuts reduce international & cultural spending.<br>3. Repeal of carbon pricing may lower household fuel bills but raise health costs from pollution. | 1. Housing and health-care capital spending concentrated in urban centres may narrow regional service gaps.<br>2. Temporary income boost for low-income seniors raises after-tax incomes by up to $1.1 bn (25-26).<br>3. Youth jobs, apprenticeship and Indigenous funds improve labour-market inclusion. |
| **Environmental sustainability** | 1. Eliminating carbon-pricing tools likely increases national GHG trajectory.<br>2. Reduced clean-tech incentives may slow EV uptake.<br>3. Outdoor Heritage Fund ($65-130 m) offers limited conservation offset. | 1. Flood-insurance and adaptation funds reduce climate-disaster vulnerability.<br>2. Clean-tech credits and grid build-out support emissions reduction.<br>3. Carbon Border Adjustment aligns with EU CBAM, potentially discouraging carbon leakage. |
| **International competitiveness & obligations** | 1. Carbon-tax repeal could trigger border-carbon tariffs abroad, harming exporters.<br>2. Defence rebuild targets NATO 2 % GDP but funding back-loaded.<br>3. Cutting foreign aid may affect diplomatic influence. | 1. Defence spending ramp meets NORAD & NATO commitments sooner.<br>2. Patent box and AI credits aim to retain high-tech IP domestically.<br>3. Tariff-impact compensation fund cushions trade retaliation risk. |

## Risk & Assumption Check-List

* **CPC revenue boost from deregulation** (EV mandate, emissions cap) rests on optimistic growth multipliers; PBO has not validated macro feedbacks. citeturn0file0  
* **Tariff response ($20 bn) in both plans** assumes equal retaliation volume and perfect collectability—highly uncertain.  
* **CPC spending cuts via 2-for-1 red-tape rule & consultant rollback** may face implementation lags and union push-back.  
* **LPC “government productivity” savings (up to $13 bn / yr)** lack methodological detail; risk of double-counting with baseline restraint. citeturn0file1  
* **LPC capital spending amortisation** obscures cash-deficit effects; total debt impact could exceed published operating balance.  
* **Both plans** use identical PBO economic baseline, vulnerable to commodity-price swings and possible U.S. recession.

## Five Questions for Voters & Policymakers

1. How credible is the shared $20 bn tariff-revenue assumption, and what are the contingency plans if receipts fall short?  
2. For the Liberal plan: what is the projected *cash* deficit and federal debt level once capital outlays are included?  
3. For the Conservative plan: how will repealing carbon pricing affect Canada’s ability to comply with existing international climate agreements?  
4. Both plans claim large “productivity” or “deregulation” gains—what independent audit mechanisms will verify these savings?  
5. Given competing spending priorities, which specific programs would each party cut or delay if economic growth underperforms?
